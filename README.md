1. Introduction to GitHub
GitHub is a popular web-based platform for version control and collaborative development, built on top of Git, a distributed version control system. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously while tracking every change made to the code. GitHub also provides cloud-based repository hosting, enabling teams to store, share, and manage their projects efficiently from anywhere.
For this assignment, GitHub is selected as one of the main collaboration tools to help students practice real-world teamwork, version control, and project management.

2. Key Features of GitHub
GitHub offers several essential features that support smooth collaboration and project organization:

Repositories (Repos):
A repository acts as the central hub of a project, containing all related files, folders, and documentation. In this assignment, the team leader will create a repository to host all project materials, including this document and a README file.

Branching:
Branching allows each collaborator to work independently on their own copy of the project without affecting the main branch. For this assignment, every team member must create a separate branch from the main branch to make their individual updates or additions.

Commits:
A commit represents a saved snapshot of changes made to one or more files. Each collaborator should make at least three commits to their branch—such as adding an introduction, details, and a conclusion—to record their progress clearly.

Merging:
Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch (e.g., a collaborator’s branch) into another (commonly the main branch). The team leader is responsible for reviewing and merging these changes once all members have completed their parts.

Conflict Resolution:
Sometimes, two collaborators may modify the same line or section of a file, leading to a merge conflict. Resolving these conflicts manually is an essential part of the merging process and a valuable teamwork skill that the team leader will practice in this assignment.

3. Conclusion
In summary, GitHub is a powerful collaboration platform that simplifies teamwork in software development. Through features such as repositories, branching, commits, merging, and conflict resolution, it provides a clear and organized workflow for managing group projects. Completing this assignment will help participants gain practical, hands-on experience with GitHub’s collaborative development process, preparing them for professional teamwork in real-world projects.
